HealAPI: Self-Healing API Test Automation System

-------------------------------------------------
Goal:
    - Detect breaking changes in API (OpenAPI spec).
    - Auto-heal broken API test cases (Postman/Pytest).
    - Re-run tests and report results.
    - Enable fully automated, low-maintenance API testing.

-------------------------------------------------
High-Level Workflow:
    1. OpenAPI Diff Engine
        - Compare old & new OpenAPI specs.
        - Output: JSON diff of changes (added/removed/renamed fields).

    2. Test Case Analyzer
        - Scan Postman collections or Pytest files.
        - Map which tests are impacted by API changes.

    3. Healing Engine
        - Use fuzzy logic & AI (LLM) to auto-fix broken tests.
        - Patch Postman JSON or Python code.

    4. Test Runner
        - Re-run healed tests (Newman for Postman, Pytest for Python).
        - Collect results.

    5. Report Generator
        - Summarize API changes, test healing actions, and test results.
        - Output as JSON, CLI, or optional HTML/Slack/email.

-------------------------------------------------
Tech Stack:
    - Language: Python 3.x
    - API Spec: openapi-spec-validator, swagger-parser, PyYAML
    - Diff: openapi-diff, custom YAML comparison
    - Testing: Postman, Newman, Pytest
    - Healing: ast, fuzzywuzzy, GPT-4, redbaron
    - CI/CD: GitHub Actions, Jenkins
    - Notification: Email, Slack (optional)

-------------------------------------------------
Future Work Steps:
    1. Scaffold modular project structure (main.py, modules for each component).
    2. Implement robust OpenAPI parsing & diffing (support YAML/JSON, handle edge cases).
    3. Build flexible test analyzers for Postman/Pytest (pluggable for other frameworks).
    4. Develop advanced healing engine (combine fuzzy, regex, and LLM-based strategies).
    5. Integrate test runners with parallel execution and error handling.
    6. Add rich reporting & notification (JSON, CLI, HTML, Slack/Email).
    7. (Optional) Auto-generate test cases from OpenAPI for new APIs.
    8. (Optional) Add dashboard/UI for test management and healing logs.
    9. (Optional) Support for additional test frameworks and API protocols.

-------------------------------------------------
Summary:
    HealAPI automates the detection, healing, and validation of API tests after every schema change, reducing manual effort and increasing reliability. The system is modular, extensible, and designed for commercial-grade automation.
